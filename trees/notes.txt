Binary tree?
complete binary tee...add all nodes from left to right...
what is perfect binary tree?  logn
skewed tree..? hieght is n
tree is non-linear data structure...
traversal tech...DFS and BFS....

BFS is also called as level order traversal....
DFS has three traversal inorder,preorder,postorder..
=============================

How to print all nodes in each level...in a tree...

check when you pop from queue, while doing DFS, whenever is queue.size is 0, print new line....

Leetcode --> binary tree level order traversal...

=======================================
2nd class --> DFS, pre/in/post order traversal..

post order traversal is used, when we parent want to use the information mentioned in child nodes.
pre-order and post-order are opposites?? check that...

find hieght of tree using post-order technique...

post-order(root)
{
    if(root==NULL) return 0;
    lh = post-order(root->lh);
    rh = post-order(root->rh);
    return max(lh,rh)+1;
}

do traversal using iterative way for example morris traversal algorithm.

for path to sum problem...use pre-order tranveral to solve that...
