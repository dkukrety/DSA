Binary tree?
complete binary tee...add all nodes from left to right...
what is perfect binary tree?  logn
skewed tree..? hieght is n
tree is non-linear data structure...
traversal tech...DFS and BFS....

BFS is also called as level order traversal....
DFS has three traversal inorder,preorder,postorder..
=============================

How to print all nodes in each level...in a tree...

check when you pop from queue, while doing DFS, whenever is queue.size is 0, print new line....

Leetcode --> binary tree level order traversal...

=======================================
2nd class --> DFS, pre/in/post order traversal..
