// Solve sudoku problem.

// Algorithm is to go through each empty cell in matrix, try to put
// 1 to 9 in k empty cell matrix by checking all conditions.
// if you reach a place where there is no solution, you will backtrack
// Here we are assuming that there is single solution existing for this matrix.

/*

Time Complexity
O(9k), where k is the number of unfilled cells.

If there is only one unfilled cell, we need to try 9 digits for the position in the worst case. With two unfilled cells, weâ€™d try up to 9 possibilities for the first position and up to 9 for the second position for every number for the first position. And so on.

The backtracking algorithm indeed avoids explicitly trying many of the impossible board positions by checking validity early, but the upper bound remains O(9k).

Auxiliary Space Used
O(k), where k is the number of unfilled cells.

Every level of recursion fills one cell.

Space Complexity
O(n2), where n * n is the board size.

We can also say that it is O(1) since n = 9 always.
